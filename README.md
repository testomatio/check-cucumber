# check-cucumber

CLI tool that checks Gherkin formatted feature files and imports them into Testomatio.

## Cli

To import tests into Testomatio run `check-cucumber` via npx:

```
TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber
```

**Note: replace API_KEY wit key from Testomatio**

### CLI Options:

- `-d, --dir` - Directory of the project
- `-c, --codeceptjs` - If it is codecept project use this option

**Note :** Running this will create Suites with folder and file name as sub suites.

To change host of endpoint for receiving data, and set it to other than app.testomat.io use TESTOMATIO_URL environment variable:

TESTOMATIO_URL=https://beta.testomat.io

### Sample Output

### Assign IDs

To set Testomatio IDs for scenarios and features in files run this command with `--update-ids` option.

```
TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber --update-ids
```

Scenarios should already be imported into Testomatio

### Disable Detached Tests

If a test from a previous import was not found on next import it is marked as "detached".
This is done to ensure that deleted tests are not staying in Testomatio while deleted in codebase.

To disable this behavior and don't mark anything on detached on import use `--no-detached` option

```
TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber --no-detached
```

## Synchronous Import

By default `check-cucumber` doesn't wait for all tests to be processed. It sends request to Testomatio and exits. To wait for processing to finish use `--sync` option.

```
TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber --sync
```

Please note, that this will take a long time on a large codebase.

## Clean Test IDs

If you want to import the synced project as new project, you have to clean the test ids. To clean the project use `--clean-ids`

```
TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber --update-ids
```

TESTOMATIO is API key for old project.

**Note:** If you don't have access to the old project you can still clean the project using `--unsafe-clean-ids`. This will clear the IDs that match the regex `@T****`. So if you have a tag like `@Test` this may also be removed. If you use this option make sure if all the test titles a proper before committing the tests in GIT.

### Import Into a Specific Suite

To put all imported tests into a specific suite (folder) pass in `TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR` environment variable:

```
TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR="MyTESTS" TESTOMATIO=API_KEY npx check-cucumber -d example/cucumber
```
